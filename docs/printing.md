# Printing at KCS

Papercut handles the copiers at Kenton City Schools. You will print to kcs-copier and be able to pick up your print job from any copier in the district. To print, you'll select kcs-copier from the list (Notice the green icon and the text Mobility Print):

If you don’t see Mobility Print, then check that you are signed in to Chrome. In the upper right corner click the circle beside the three dot menu and verify that you are signed in there:

If you are not, then sign in. Once Chrome finishes syncing your settings and extensions, mobility print will show up.

You will have to sign in to Papercut Mobility Print the first time you use it. Use your full email address and your Google password.

Use your full email address! Sometimes I have to reset your Google password before Papercut will recognize it, so let me know if you have problems signing in.

But, how do I select my favorite copier? How do I know where I will pick up my print job? Well, let me take that great burden off of you. When you select kcs-copier, your print job is held until you sign in on a copier with your PIN. This means you can go to any copier in the district, sign in, and then print your print jobs. Even between buildings!

Once you put in your PIN, all of your print jobs will be sitting there waiting for you. Select the jobs you want to print and then print! You don't have to print all of your jobs. For example, you can send two print jobs, and one you want to print in color. You can print the B&W job at the copier closest to you, and then go to the office to print the color job.
