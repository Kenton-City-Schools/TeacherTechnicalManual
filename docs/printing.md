# Printing at KCS

Papercut handles the copiers at Kenton City Schools. You will print to kcs-copier and be able to pick up your print job from any copier in the district. To print, you'll select kcs-copier from the list (Notice the green icon and the text Mobility Print):

If you don’t see Mobility Print, then check that you are signed in to Chrome. In the upper right corner click the circle beside the three dot menu and verify that you are signed in there:

If you are not, then sign in. Once Chrome finishes syncing your settings and extensions, mobility print will show up.

You will have to sign in to Papercut Mobility Print the first time you use it. Use your full email address and your Google password.

Use your full email address! Sometimes I have to reset your Google password before Papercut will recognize it, so let me know if you have problems signing in.

But, how do I select my favorite copier? How do I know where I will pick up my print job? Well, let me take that great burden off of you. When you select kcs-copier, your print job is held until you sign in on a copier with your PIN. This means you can go to any copier in the district, sign in, and then print your print jobs. Even between buildings!

Once you put in your PIN, all of your print jobs will be sitting there waiting for you. Select the jobs you want to print and then print! You don't have to print all of your jobs. For example, you can send two print jobs, and one you want to print in color. You can print the B&W job at the copier closest to you, and then go to the office to print the color job.

## If you are having issues finding the new kcs-copier

In Google Chrome, go to Print, and then select See More... under the current printer:

In the list, kcs-copier will appear:

You may need to scroll down on the list. 

Also, if you are not using a Chromebook check that you are signed in and syncing in Google Chrome:

## Printing double-sided

  
Two ways. When printing, select kcs-copier and print to it. Go to the copier and hit the > beside the print job to select the settings. From there you can change the number of copies and whether you want it 1 sided or 2:

**THIS DOESN'T WORK WHEN PRINTING TO `[KCS] Copier`!!**

You can also use the following to send your print job as double-sided to [KCS] Copier, but it's a lot more steps.

Under More Settings click Print using system dialog:

Scroll down to Printer Options:

And click the circled I by Layout and Finish:

Under Print Type: select 2-Sided, and then print.

## I’m printing but the print jobs aren’t showing up on the copier!

The printer may be paused. If you print when you are not on the school network, the Mac pauses the printer. This is all well and good, except for the fact that when you get back to school it doesn’t unpause it so your printing never makes it anywhere.

1) To unpause, open the Apple Menu > System Preferences:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/B432xVCoeuVZ_On5cSqvhDAzGukSr2UJqPApB5v72yPcoGj1OVHI6ZUmpiWzfJdPJl__ID1VnLjRqaWSecvT7Ep8_qN3tbZDPdqviCMCPedjqsoWo5tkTTj8cWOiCgIvyH8pPxHuhSnK6fc1x8r4RR0)

2) Find Printers & Scanners:

3) The paused printers will have the word Paused in yellow under the printer name:

4) Double-click on the printer. In the upper right corner of the window will be a play button. Click it to unpause the printer:

## When I try to print from Google Docs/Sheets/Slides etc. the PDF downloads and then I have to print

Use Google Chrome and you won’t have to download the file before printing.

## Copier issues - crashes when trying to print PDFs or takes a really long time

There are PDFs, usually downloaded from a very popular source, that happen to crash the copiers. You’ll know when you get one because some pages of the document will print while others will not. To fix the issue, we need to open the document up in Adobe Reader and print each page as an image. That’s a lot of directions in so few of words, let’s break it down.

Open the PDF in Adobe Reader

For the first part, you will need to open the problem PDF in Adobe Reader instead of the default Preview or Google Chrome. There are two ways to do that.

### First way

1. Navigate to the Hard Drive, select Applications, and double-click on Adobe Reader.
    
2. Use the File menu, select Open, and open the PDF.
    

### Second Way

1. Locate the PDF in your Downloads folder.
    
2. Right-click on the document (on the trackpads, a two finger click is a right click).
    
3. Select Open With -> Adobe Reader from the menu:  
    ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uX3u5VR_Qpw1IJp9zAiQphiAXCT8fNwV7T28au4mUjK7_6XPsWIeH9DV31xO3OR7jlppFaAjQ7xmPgOO7inh8P_3mZtzQhv_cxh-WDKF6MaFpk2Dgl_zwJ4oXhCySWPvct4psMyZ43uy9jjA25ceIXA)
    

### Printing the document

1. Once Adobe Reader opens, go to File -> Print:  
    ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mEO3EZfRyVJAy1E-AAafyLanP4DfrhjptIrDhARz5_uIkjR6ia8yulzK8fMweH2JcvkuSFh7gbJPUTcAUV4tHxa8AmUoWc0TymQP0WVxlpdlElbvbpOZaBReoL2ocKKSgYhYkchZXmuPCRRWiOctWCQ)
    
2. In the Print Dialog box, click the Advanced button:  
    ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/n4xT53N2T0cFXejfZrgfZ_Ti2TEAqJFTmrHGjmOezUQVLcEZ3wUslcdbWx4g5xpCSUNLOg8q63P9aZfAJUlCvSmwnpIoR8PeV3aH7TTwMEYFIzH6MkedyuMPJBY5SmM2mOWFr6HlFK6-qyMHgyCVZYw)
    
3. Finally, select Print as Image:  
    ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SqyNpdrSBjeVzuUkcQCTCe15bFM3OhrjpmpbMl_IpCdNAPcbijV00YfZ2Y8jIZRsvlPN1cYTvV5hjevb1yobDQikZzz5bHLfH-E_SXqeHNLBGfPIbDL25eWjNboiCiMrLD9xJOjsxKGRuUTC_m_gs2A)
    
4. Click OK and then print your document as normal.
    

The process will take much longer than normal, but that’s the price for actually getting a document to print.
