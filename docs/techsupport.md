## Student computer repair instructions

Every student in grades K-12 is assigned a Chromebook. For students in grades K-6 their laptops stay in their homeroom, while students in grades 7-12 are allowed to take their laptops home. 

If a laptop needs to be repaired, the directions are different whether they are in the elementary school or middle/high school.

### Kenton Elementary School Students

When a laptop at the elementary school needs to be repaired, the homeroom teacher will use the [Device Repair Form](https://go.kcs.me/repairform) ([go.kcs.me/repairform](https://go.kcs.me/repairform)) to begin the process. Once the repair has been entered, the elementary technology teacher will swap the bad unit with a loaner and send the bad unit to Northwood to be repaired. All teachers have a Chromebook assigned to them, and this Chromebook can be used by students if the need arises.

Once the unit is repaired it will be sent back to the elementary school and the elementary technology teacher will retrieve the loaner and put the repaired unit back.

### Kenton Middle School Students

Students will take their broken units to the office where the office secretary will assist the students in filling out the  [Device Repair Form](https://go.kcs.me/repairform) ([go.kcs.me/repairform](https://go.kcs.me/repairform)). A loaner will be assigned to the student to use. This loaner can go home if the office deems it necessary.

### Kenton High School Students

Students will take their broken units to the Makerspace where the media specialist will assist the students in filling out the  [Device Repair Form](https://go.kcs.me/repairform) ([go.kcs.me/repairform](https://go.kcs.me/repairform)). A loaner will be assigned to the student to use. This loaner can go home if the office deems it necessary.
