# Student accounts

## New student procedures

When new students enter the district, the process of account creation and rostering happens the day after they get a schedule. At that time their Google account will get made, a laptop will be assigned, and the process of syncing that information with the various curriculum websites will begin. The syncing process takes a minimum of two days, which means the new students will not show up in any of the online services for at least this amount of time. If a student does not show up after 4 days, please submit a help desk request with the student name and id # so an investigation can begin.

When new students are assigned at the elementary school, the elementary tech person will drop off a laptop to be used by the new student and the classroom inventory sheet will be updated. For the middle school and high school a laptop will be assigned and a new student info sheet will be printed and placed in the laptop to be sent to the respective building for the student.
