How do I know where I will pick up my print job? Well, let me take that great burden off of you. When you select kcs-copier, your print job is held until you sign in on a copier with your PIN.

Even between buildings!</p> <p>Once you put in your PIN, all of your print jobs will be sitting there waiting for you. Select the jobs you want to print and then print! You don't have to print all of your jobs. For example, you can send two print jobs, and one you want to print in color. You can print the B&amp;W job at the copier closest to you, and then go to the office to print the color job.</p>"},{"location":"printing/#if-you-are-having-issues-finding-the-new-kcs-copier","title":"If you are having issues finding the new kcs-copier","text":"<p>In Google Chrome, go to Print, and then select See More... under the current printer:</p> <p></p> <p>In the list, kcs-copier will appear:</p> <p></p> <p>You may need to scroll down on the list.\u00a0</p> <p>Also, if you are not using a Chromebook check that you are signed in and syncing in Google Chrome:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"printing/#printing-double-sided","title":"Printing double-sided","text":"<p>Two ways.
