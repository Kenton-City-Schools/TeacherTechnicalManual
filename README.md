# The Kenton City Schools Teacher Technical Manual

I've converted the 67 page Google Doc to this site using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). Besides the installing mkdocs through pip, I also installed the them with `pip install mkdocs-material`.
Pages are deployed to Github with `mkdocs gh-deploy`.
